## Database Setup

* Open a terminal window.
* Run the following command to access the PostgreSQL command line client as the postgres user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

* Once you are in the PostgreSQL command line client, you should see a prompt that looks like this:

```bash
postgres=#
```

* Now, you can create the projectx database by entering the following SQL command:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE projectx;
```

After running this command, you should see a confirmation message.

* Exit the PostgreSQL command line client by typing:

```bash
\q
```

* Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Now your project is set up and ready to run!
